# Chart Viewer Consolidation Summary

## What Was Consolidated

Previously, there were three separate viewing scripts with duplicated
functionality:

1. **`view_plots.py`** - Basic chart viewer for all PNG files
2. **`view_comprehensive_aces_chart.py`** - Specialized viewer for ACES
   comparison
3. **`view_merged_ocio_chart.py`** - Specialized viewer for merged OCIO
   comparison

## New Unified Solution

All functionality has been merged into a single comprehensive script:
**`view_plots.py`**

### Key Features

#### Command-Line Interface

```bash
python view_plots.py                    # View all charts
python view_plots.py <chart_name>       # View specific chart
python view_plots.py --list             # List available charts
python view_plots.py --help             # Show help
```

#### Chart-Specific Descriptions

Each chart type now has detailed descriptions explaining:

- What the chart shows
- Key features and insights
- How to interpret the data
- Color coding and annotations

#### Smart Chart Discovery

- Partial name matching for easy selection
- Automatic chart availability checking
- Descriptive error messages
- Proper chart sizing for each type

#### Enhanced User Experience

- Consistent formatting and emoji indicators
- Detailed explanations before displaying charts
- Proper error handling and graceful failures
- Comprehensive help and usage instructions

## Supported Chart Types

1. **Comprehensive ACES Comparison** (`comprehensive`)
   - ACES 1.0 vs 2.0 across all dimensions
   - Side-by-side performance comparison

2. **Merged OCIO 2.4.1 vs 2.4.2 Comparison** (`merged`)
   - Both ACES versions on same scale
   - Four-way comparison visualization

3. **Summary Analysis Overview** (`summary`)
   - Multi-panel comprehensive overview
   - Heatmaps, histograms, and comparisons

4. **OCIO Version Performance Comparison** (`version`)
   - Version-specific performance analysis
   - Cross-version comparison insights

## Benefits of Consolidation

- **Eliminated Code Duplication** - Single source of truth for chart viewing
- **Improved Maintainability** - One script to update instead of three
- **Enhanced Functionality** - Command-line interface with rich options
- **Better User Experience** - Consistent interface and detailed guidance
- **Simplified Workflow** - Single command for all chart viewing needs

## Usage Examples

```bash
# View all charts with descriptions
python view_plots.py

# Quick view of specific charts
python view_plots.py aces
python view_plots.py ocio
python view_plots.py summary

# Get help and see all options
python view_plots.py --help

# Check what charts are available
python view_plots.py --list
```

The consolidated viewer maintains all the specialized functionality of the
original scripts while providing a unified, enhanced experience for viewing
OCIO performance analysis results.
