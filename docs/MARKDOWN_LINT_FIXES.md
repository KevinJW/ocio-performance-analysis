ACES version (ACES 1.0 vs ACES 2.0), highlighting the significant performance
differences between these two color space conversion standards.
```

### MD022 - Headers Should Be Surrounded by Blank Lines

**Issue**: Missing blank lines before and after headers
**Fix**: Added proper spacing around all headers

**Example**:

```markdown
# Before
### Overall ACES Version Performance
- **ACES 1.0**: 278.07 Â± 64.80 ms

# After
### Overall ACES Version Performance

- **ACES 1.0**: 278.07 Â± 64.80 ms
```

### MD032 - Lists Should Be Surrounded by Blank Lines

**Issue**: Missing blank lines before and after lists
**Fix**: Added proper spacing around all lists

**Example**:

```markdown
# Before
Each chart type now has detailed descriptions explaining:
- What the chart shows
- Key features and insights

# After
Each chart type now has detailed descriptions explaining:

```

### MD040 - Fenced Code Blocks Should Have Language Specified

**Issue**: Code blocks without language specification
**Fix**: Added appropriate language identifiers

**Example**:

```markdown
# Before
```
python view_plots.py --help
```

# After
```bash
python view_plots.py --help
```
```
